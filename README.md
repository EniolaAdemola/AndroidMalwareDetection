## Android Malware Detection Project

## About the Project
[Android Malware Detection](https://androidmalwaredetection.herokuapp.com/) is a Malware Website Application i created using Python, Machine Learning Models and Streamlit, the website application detects the status of an android application ( MALWARE or DENIGN), the test data set has been extracted from thousand of applications with intents, permissions and may more just to build the awesome Machine Learning Model. 


## How to test the Model
This Project is an MSC project made for a client but i've decided to share it here on github, there is a pass to the model itself but i would show how everything works here. to get the pass just **[tweet me](http://twitter.com/_daveworld)**
